Chatbot StockAPI is a **highly interactive real-time application** designed to provide users with **live updates on stock market data**. Leveraging an integration with the [Stooq](https://stooq.com) API for its stock market information, this chatbot ensures users are provided with the most up-to-date financial data.

The application leverages **NATS** as a messaging system to enable seamless communication between components and **Redis** for efficient data caching and storage.

## üí° About The Project

The primary objective of Chatbot StockAPI is to enable users to query for live stock market data through a convenient chat interface. The application is structured around two main components:

- The **chatroom service**, which manages user interactions, including registration, login, and chatroom activities.
- The **bot service**, which interfaces with the external Stock API to fetch live stock market data and communicates this information to the chatroom service via NATS messaging.
  
To ensure high performance and real-time updates, the application takes advantage of Go's built-in concurrency features, including goroutines, channels, and mutexes. This allows for multiple chatroom activities to be handled simultaneously and efficiently, and for data to be securely fetched and sent without causing race conditions.

## üìñ Project Structure

The application is structured into several key directories:

- `botService`: Contains the logic for the bot service that communicates with the Stock API.
- `cmd`: Includes the main application entry points and utility scripts like `stop-start.sh`.
- `Docker`: Contains Dockerfiles for the different services and docker-compose for starting the services.
- `handle`: Includes the handlers for the different routes in the application.
- `model`: Contains the data structures used across the application.
- `natsclient`: Code related to NATS client implementation.
- `redis`: Code related to Redis client implementation.
- `static`: Holds static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend of the chatbot.
- `ws`: Includes the implementation of the Websocket server used for real-time communication. This part of the application leverages channels for synchronizing and communicating between goroutines.


## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/ThaisGLeite/chatbot-stockapi.git`
2. **Navigate into the project directory**: `cd chatbot-stockapi`
3. **Run the `stop-start.sh` script**: `./cmd/stop-start.sh`

The Chatbot application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`, and the BotService at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the `stop-start.sh` Script

The `stop-start.sh` script is a utility script provided in this repository to help manage the Docker containers for this project. Here is a brief rundown of its functionality:

1. It navigates to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. It stops any running containers associated with the `docker-compose.yml` file using `docker-compose down`. This is useful if you have previously started containers and want to ensure a clean slate.
3. It builds the services and recreates the containers from scratch using `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`. This ensures that any changes you have made to your Docker files will be included when the containers are restarted.

You can run this script from the `cmd` directory with the command `./stop-start.sh`. Ensure the script has the appropriate permissions to be executed (`chmod +x stop-start.sh` if needed).

## üîß Services

1. **BotService**: This is a Go service that communicates with the Stock API. It subscribes to a NATS subject "stock_codes", and upon receiving messages, it fetches the corresponding stock data and publishes it back to NATS.
2. **Chatroom**: This is the main chat application. It handles user registration and login, JWT token generation and validation, creation of chatrooms, and sending/receiving messages. It listens to stock updates published by the BotService via NATS and pushes them to connected clients over WebSockets.
3. **NATS**: An open-source messaging system used for communication between the BotService and Chatroom.
4. **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a cache and a message broker. In this application, it stores user data and session information, as well as chatroom details and messages.
